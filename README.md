### Project Overview
This project explores the distribution and diversity of bird species across forest and grassland ecosystems, using real-world observational data. By analyzing environmental and temporal factors, we aim to understand how different habitats influence avian biodiversity and behaviorâ€”supporting conservation planning and biodiversity monitoring.

### Problem Statement
Analyze bird species observations across forest and grassland habitats to:
Understand habitat preferences
Assess environmental impact on bird populations
Reveal patterns in bird behavior and diversity

### Skills Applied
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Data Visualization - Power BI
